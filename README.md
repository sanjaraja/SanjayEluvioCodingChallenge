# SanjayEluvioCodingChallenge
 
 This is my solution to the "Option 3 - Applications" part of the coding challenge. In order to run this program please ensure you have python installed in your system. The solution is located in solution.py . My general approach to this problem was to use threading in order to make sure that 5 requests are made to the server simultaneously in order to improve performance. I also use a set to keep to ensure that we only make requests for unique sets.
